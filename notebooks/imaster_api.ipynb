    "# This notebook shall serve as a base to experiment with simple API calls from the IMaster API.\n",

    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write script to obtain all available measurements for a specific timestamp. \n",
    "* Understand how many measurements are available per day - are they complete or are some more frequently recorded than others?\n",
    "* Understand how to process the data timewise: If we are looking at a timestamp, does it make sense to build averages/medians/etc for measurements around this timestamp/this day?\n",
    "\n",
    "* IMPORTANT: How to obtain measurements taken at the same time as a given image? Apparently the timestamps are not at sync. Do we need to write a function that finds the closest timestamp for a given image - or shall we take average for a specific time around that image again? ---> Different approaches possible. "
